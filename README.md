# GuardianConnect
API / VPN Framework for Guardian Firewall iOS application

To build an xcframework for iOS change into the root folder and run

./build_ios_framework.sh

if all goes well you should have GuardianConnect.xcframework in that folder upon completion.

This is an experimental branch to create a sample macOS app with the GuardianConnect framework. It illustrates how quickly and easily you can get everything set up with minimal code.
