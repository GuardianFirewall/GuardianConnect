# GuardianConnect
API / VPN Framework for Guardian Firewall iOS application

To build an xcframework for iOS or mac change into the root folder and run

./build_framework.sh

if all goes well you should have GuardianConnect.xcframework in that folder upon completion.

There is now a sample POC macintosh client available in the repo it is almost completely fully featured, including blocklist support & in app purchases.

There is also an iOS sample project in Swift to show how easy it is to integrate with either language. (Obj-C or Swift)
