# GuardianConnect
API / VPN Framework for Guardian Firewall iOS application

To build an xcframework for iOS change into the root folder and run

./build_ios_framework.sh

if all goes well you should have GuardianConnect.xcframework in that folder upon completion.

There is now a sample POC macintosh client available in the repo, it does not have IAP implemented but can sign in to a pro account OR use a receipt data file from the iOS app with existing purchases to create a valid account.
