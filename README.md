# GuardianConnect
API / VPN Framework for Guardian Firewall iOS application

To build an xcframework for iOS or mac change into the root folder and run OR change to the target XCFramework and build straight from Xcode

./build_framework.sh

if all goes well you should have GuardianConnect.xcframework in that folder upon completion.

There is an iOS sample project in Swift to show how easy it is to integrate.
